# InkSpire API Documentation

InkSpire is a platform for inspiring writings and ideas, providing a full-featured API to manage users, articles, comments, and likes. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for integrating with the platform's endpoints.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Base URL
All API calls should be made to the following base URL:
`http://localhost:4444/api`

### Authentication
Authentication is handled via a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**, which is set in an **HTTP-only cookie** named `token` upon successful login. This token must be present in subsequent requests for all private routes.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application utilizes a secure, decoupled architecture where the frontend and backend interact via defined API endpoints.

### FrontEnd API EndPoints Flow

This diagram illustrates the client-side approach, differentiating between public routes handled by **Axios** and private, authenticated routes managed efficiently using **RTK Query**.



### BackEnd API EndPoints Flow

This diagram details the server-side structure, showing how incoming requests are routed through `index.js` to specific routers (`auth.js`, `post.js`, `like.js`, `gemini.js`) and how the crucial **`verify JWT` middleware** protects private routes.
